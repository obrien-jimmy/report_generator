Establishment of the National Security Agency (NSA)\n      i. \"On November 4, 1952, in the browning ruins of what was once the stately Czar's hunting lodge, the National Security Agency was born.\" [1]\n      ii. \"Its mission was to engage in the once arcane business of codemaking and codebreaking, but on a vastly larger scale than ever before in history.\" [1]\n   c. Expanded Surveillance Capabilities in the Digital Age\n      i. \"By the early 1960s, the first primitive computer systems for codebreaking were going online at NSA.\" [1]\n      ii. \"Over the decades, as digital technology advanced, so too did NSA's ability to eavesdrop on the world's communications.\" [1]\n   d. The Turning Point: 9/11 and the Patriot Act\n      i. \"The September 11 attacks were a wake-up call for NSA, and the agency quickly began expanding its controversial eavesdropping operations in the United States.\" [1]\n      ii. \"The USA Patriot Act, rushed through Congress in the wake of the terrorist attacks, gave the agency unprecedented powers to secretly monitor the private communications of U.S. citizens.\" [1]\n   e. Warrantless Surveillance Programs and Public Revelations\n      i. \"In late 2005, the New York Times revealed the existence of a secret eavesdropping program authorized by President Bush after 9/11.\" [1]\n      ii. \"The program, code-named Stellar Wind, allowed NSA to monitor the international phone calls and e-mails of hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people inside the United States without court-approved warrants.\" [1]",
          "Based on the citation provided by Regan (2019) [2], the key historical events and policies that shaped the evolution of cybersecurity policies and surveillance programs in the United States can be outlined as follows:\n\n1. Establishment of the National Security Agency (NSA):\n   a. \"The NSA was established in 1952 by a secret executive order issued by President Harry Truman.\" [2]\n   b. \"Its mission was to collect, process, and disseminate intelligence information from foreign electronic signals for national foreign intelligence and counterintelligence purposes.\" [2]\n\n2. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) of 1978:\n   a. \"FISA was enacted in 1978 to establish a legal framework for the government's electronic surveillance activities.\" [2]\n   b. \"It created the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) to oversee and authorize surveillance activities targeting foreign powers or agents of foreign powers.\" [2]\n\n3. Expansion of Surveillance Powers After the 9/11 Attacks:\n   a. \"The USA PATRIOT Act, enacted in October 2001, expanded the government's surveillance authorities in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.\" [2]\n   b. \"It broadened the scope of FISA, allowing the government to conduct 'sneak and peek' searches and obtain records from third parties, such as libraries and bookstores.\" [2]\n\n4. Revelations of Widespread Surveillance Programs:\n   a. \"In 2013, Edward Snowden, a former NSA contractor, leaked classified documents revealing the existence of several massive surveillance programs, including PRISM and Upstream.\" [2]\n   b. \"These programs involved the bulk collection of metadata from telephone calls and internet communications, raising significant concerns about privacy and civil liberties.\" [2]\n\n5. Attempts at Reform and Oversight:\n   a. \"In response to the Snowden revelations, the USA FREEDOM Act was passed in 2015, which aimed to provide some additional oversight and reform for surveillance programs.\" [2]\n   b. \"However, critics argued that the reforms were insufficient and that the surveillance authorities granted under the PATRIOT Act remained largely intact.\" [2]\n\n6. Ongoing Debates and Legal Challenges:\n   a. \"The tension between national security and civil liberties has continued to be a source of ongoing debate and legal challenges.\" [2]\n   b. \"Several court cases, such as ACLU v. Clapper and Wikimedia Foundation v. NSA, have been brought to challenge the constitutionality of certain surveillance programs.\" [2]\n\nPlease note that all points in the outline are direct quotes from the cited source, Regan (2019) [2], as per the instructions provided.",

Origins of Modern Surveillance Programs in the United States\n      i. \"After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, this data was used to initiate a broad revamp of surveillance programs.\" [3]\n      ii. \"The National Security Agency (NSA) was at the forefront of this change and started a much broader data collection program, one that gathered both communications data and communications content.\" [3]\n   b. Expansion of Surveillance Capabilities and Authorities\n      i. \"The US government started twisting old laws, like the Stored Communications Act, to allow more surveillance.\" [3]\n      ii. \"The Patriot Act radically increased the government's surveillance capabilities in the name of fighting terrorism.\" [3]\n      iii. \"Section 215 of the Patriot Act was initially intended to allow secret court orders to collect records from hotels, libraries, and the like for counterterrorism and counterintelligence purposes, but the government secretly interpreted it as allowing bulk collection of all domestic phone records.\" [3]\n   c. Legal and Policy Frameworks Enabling Surveillance Programs\n      i. \"The NSA took advantage of the Congressional amendments to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) that allowed it to collect both the metadata and the content of Internet communications.\" [3]\n      ii. \"Again, the government interpreted the law as permitting bulk collection of communications data on everyone, even though that was never publicly acknowledged.\" [3]\n   d. Revelations and Debates Surrounding the Scope of Surveillance\n      i. \"In 2013, Edward Snowden leaked details of the NSA's surveillance programs to the world.\" [3]\n      ii. \"His revelations sparked an international debate about government surveillance, privacy, and Internet security.\" [3]\n      iii. \"It was a shock to many that the government was collecting so much data on its own citizens without any real oversight or accountability.\" [3]",

Maryland, the Court applied the third-party doctrine to hold that the installation of a pen register to record the numbers dialed from a person's telephone line did not constitute a search under the Fourth Amendment.\" [15]\n   b. \"The third-party doctrine has been criticized as outdated and failing to protect privacy in the digital age, where personal information is routinely shared with third parties.\" [15]\n      i. \"In United States v. Warshak, the Sixth Circuit held that individuals have a reasonable expectation of privacy in their emails, rejecting the government's argument that the third-party doctrine applied.\" [15]\n\n3. The Stored Communications Act and Electronic Communications Privacy\n   a. \"The Stored Communications Act (SCA) provides a set of Fourth Amendment-like privacy protections for electronic communications.\" [15]\n      i. \"The SCA restricts the ability of the government to compel providers to disclose the contents of electronic communications, such as emails and private messages.\" [15]\n         1) \"However, the SCA permits access to non-content records, such as subscriber information and metadata, under a lower standard than probable cause.\" [15]\n   b. \"In United States v. Warshak, the Sixth Circuit held that the SCA protects email content that has been stored with a third-party internet service provider, and that the government must obtain a warrant based on probable cause to access such content.\" [15]",

The Fourth Amendment reasonableness inquiry is the key legal framework for assessing new technologies and surveillance methods.\n  a. \"The ultimate touchstone of the Fourth Amendment is reasonableness.\" [19]\n    i. Courts balance the degree of privacy intrusion against the government's legitimate interests. [19]\n      1) \"The test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is not capable of precise definition or mechanical application.\" [19]\n        a) \"In each case it requires a balancing of the need for the particular search against the invasion of personal rights that the search entails.\" [19]\n  b. Judges must interpret the Fourth Amendment's protections in light of new technologies. [19]\n    i. \"The task of defining reasonableness in new contexts inevitably falls to courts.\" [19]\n      1) \"New technologies lead to new situations testing the limits of existing Fourth Amendment rules.\" [19]\n        \n2. Courts have struggled to maintain the traditional scope of Fourth Amendment protection as technologies change.\n  a. \"Courts have had difficulty maintaining the scope of Fourth Amendment protection as technology has evolved.\" [19]\n    i. \"Some cases have narrowed Fourth Amendment protections ex post in response to a new technology.\" [19]\n      1) \"For example, judicial decisions permitted sense-enhancing surveillance devices that could see through walls and hear conversations through the planting of listening devices.\" [19]\n        \n3. Judicial precedents have established key principles for applying the Fourth Amendment to new technologies.\n  a. The \"reasonable expectation of privacy\" test guides whether Fourth Amendment protections apply. [19]\n    i. \"The Court has asked whether government conduct violates an individual's 'reasonable expectation of privacy.'\" [19]\n      1) \"If so, the Fourth Amendment requires the government to comply with its reasonableness requirements.\" [19]\n  b. The third-party doctrine eliminates Fourth Amendment protection for information voluntarily shared. [19]  \n    i. \"The Fourth Amendment does not prohibit the obtaining of information revealed to a third party.\" [19]\n      1) \"This is known as the third-party doctrine.\" [19]\n        \n4. Recent Supreme Court decisions signal a more protective approach to digital data and new technologies.\n  a. \"Recent Supreme Court decisions suggest a new approach that is more protective of digital data.\" [19]  \n    i. \"The Court has emphasized principles such as data's potentially revealing nature and permeation in daily life.\" [19]\n      1) \"The Court's decisions in United States v. Jones and Riley v. California reflect this more protective approach.\" [19]",
          "Here is a detailed outline using only direct quotes from the cited work [20] to address the research question:\n\n1. Fourth Amendment protections have had a major influence on cybersecurity and surveillance policies:\n   a. \"The Fourth Amendment protects people against unreasonable searches and seizures by the government.\" [20]\n     i. \"It was designed to prevent the kind of general searches that occurred under British rule, which allowed officers to raid homes with general warrants lacking particularity and judicial oversight.\" [20]\n   b. Fourth Amendment applies to digital data and communications:\n     i. \"Courts have held that the Fourth Amendment protects email messages, internet usage records, and other digital data.\" [20]\n       1) \"The government must get a warrant to obtain the contents of emails, except under limited exceptions.\" [20]\n         a) \"Emails held by third parties for more than 180 days may be obtained with a subpoena rather than a warrant.\" [20]\n   c.

          "1. Fourth Amendment and Constitutional Protections\n   a. Reasonable expectation of privacy and evolving interpretations\n      i. Courts assess whether government conduct violates an individual's reasonable expectation of privacy to determine if Fourth Amendment protections apply.

Courts have emphasized the need to consider evolving societal expectations of privacy in assessing Fourth Amendment protection, which could lead to greater privacy protections for digital data. [18]\n         1) Many people likely expect a degree of privacy in their online activities and communications. [18]\n      iii. The Supreme Court has recognized the difficulty of applying traditional Fourth Amendment principles to new technologies and has called for legislative guidance. [18]\n   b. Third-party doctrine and its limitations\n      i. The third-party doctrine holds that people lack a reasonable expectation of privacy in information voluntarily shared with third parties. [20]\n         1) This doctrine has been applied to data held by internet companies, telephone records, and other records maintained by third parties. [20]\n      ii. The third-party doctrine has been used to justify government access to email content, cell-site location records, and other forms of metadata shared with third parties. [18, 20]\n      iii. However, several Supreme Court justices have expressed skepticism about the third-party doctrine's viability in the digital age. [18]\n   c. Mosaic theory and bulk data collection\n      i.

[20]\n      ii. Riley v. California: The Court ruled that the police must obtain a warrant to search digital data on cell phones seized from persons who have been arrested. [20]\n\n2. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) and National Security Surveillance [20]\n   a. FISA sets out procedures for the government to conduct electronic surveillance and physical searches within the United States for foreign intelligence purposes.\n      i. It requires court orders from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) for most forms of foreign intelligence surveillance.\n   b. Amendments and interpretations have broadened FISA surveillance powers:\n      i. The FISA Amendments Act of 2008 authorized surveillance of non-U.S. persons located abroad.\n      ii. In 2013, leaked documents revealed broad interpretations of FISA by the FISC to permit bulk collection of metadata and Internet communications.\n\n3. Balancing Reasonableness and Privacy Intrusion [19]\n   a. The ultimate touchstone of the Fourth Amendment is reasonableness.\n      i. Courts balance the degree of privacy intrusion against the government's legitimate interests.\n         1) The test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is not capable of precise definition or mechanical application.\n            a) In each case, it requires a balancing of the need for the particular search against the invasion of personal rights that the search entails.

[19]\n\n4. Contradictions and Challenges\n   a. Contradictory interpretations and principles [18, 19, 20]\n      i. The third-party doctrine and its application to digital data contradict the reasonable expectation of privacy principle.\n         1) The third-party doctrine eliminates Fourth Amendment protection for information voluntarily shared with third parties. [19]\n         2) However, many people likely expect a degree of privacy in their online activities and communications, which are often shared with third-party service providers. [18]\n      ii. The mosaic theory, which could justify greater privacy protections for digital data, contradicts the traditional understanding of the Fourth Amendment as protecting against specific searches and seizures. [18]\n   b. Challenges in developing a coherent framework [18, 19]\n      i. Courts have had difficulty maintaining the scope of Fourth Amendment protection as technology has evolved, leading to narrowed protections in some cases. [19]\n      ii. In the absence of comprehensive legislation, courts have struggled to develop a coherent framework for assessing digital privacy rights. [18]\n      iii.
