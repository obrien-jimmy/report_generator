# CONTEXT CONSIDERATIONS
Ideal Chronology and Section Objectives for an Automated Research Paper Writer
In professional research writing – including domains like defense, security, and intelligence analysis – a clear process and structure are key. An automated tool that aids in writing such papers should mimic the way experts approach a project: gathering evidence, refining the focus, and iteratively building each section of the paper. Below we propose an ideal step-by-step chronology for the system, along with the core accomplishments and objectives for each section of the paper. This approach recognizes that some sections (like the Introduction and Conclusion) will be drafted in preliminary form early on but finalized later once the study’s details are known

. It also emphasizes that the process need not be strictly linear – the tool can work out of order and revisit sections as needed, ensuring consistency and completeness.
Chronological Stages of the Writing Process
Formulate and Refine the Research Question – The process begins with the user’s initial topic or thesis statement. The system should articulate this into a clear research question or hypothesis as a starting point. Crucially, this question is treated as a working hypothesis that can evolve. The tool should perform a brief preliminary literature scan on the topic to ground itself in existing knowledge and confirm the question’s relevance. Researchers often refine their research question as they review related literature
research.com
. In practice, starting with a provisional thesis and then adjusting it based on initial findings leads to a stronger focus
zemith.com
. Accomplishments: Define the problem scope and significance, draft a tentative thesis statement or research question, and ensure it’s appropriately scoped (not too broad or vague). If the initial scan shows the question is too broad or already well-answered, the system should narrow or adjust it accordingly (this autonomous refinement is an important step). By the end of this stage, the tool has a clear, refined direction for the paper.
Conduct a Comprehensive Literature Review – With a focused question in hand, the system should dive into gathering and synthesizing existing knowledge on the topic. A literature review is the foundation of any scholarly paper, as it situates the research within the ongoing academic conversation, reveals gaps in current understanding, and justifies the need for the study
zemith.com
. At this stage, the tool identifies relevant sources from the selected categories (e.g. academic journals, industry reports, intelligence analyses, etc.) and compiles the key findings and theories from each. The literature review section’s main accomplishment is to provide context and identify the knowledge gap that the current paper will address. Performing this review early guides the paper’s direction and can even prompt revising the research question if needed (for example, discovering a certain angle is over-examined or a gap is elsewhere). Indeed, the literature review process often helps refine the research question and framework for the study
research.com
. Accomplishments: By the end of this stage, the system should have a structured summary of prior work, an understanding of prevailing theories or data on the topic, and a clear articulation of how the proposed research fits in (what it will add or why it’s needed). For now, these findings can be stored or noted; the actual writing of the Literature Review section may be completed or polished later in the process. Some experts even suggest holding off on finalizing the written literature review until after obtaining results, so that it stays sharply focused on relevant prior work. In our approach, the tool gathers the content now as a foundation and can trim or refine the written review in a later iteration.
Develop an Outline of Sections – Using the refined thesis and insights from the literature review, the system next creates a high-level outline of the paper. This outline should include the standard sections (e.g. Introduction, Literature Review, Methodology, Results/Findings, Discussion/Analysis, Conclusion) tailored to the chosen methodology (qualitative, quantitative, or a pure literature review). Crafting a detailed outline at this stage ensures the paper will have a logical flow and that each part will support the thesis. An outline is essentially the architectural blueprint of the argument, preventing a disorganized approach and making the writing process manageable
zemith.com
. Accomplishments: Lay out the main sections and sub-sections. For example, under “Methodology” the outline might list subsections like Data Collection, Analytical Technique, etc.; under “Discussion,” it might anticipate subsections for Implications, Limitations, or Recommendations. At this point the Introduction and Conclusion are included in the outline as placeholders – the Introduction can be sketched with broad strokes (e.g. a statement of the problem and why it’s important, drawing on key references from the lit review), and the Conclusion left as a note to summarize findings later. The outline serves as a roadmap, and having it early is shown to save time by guiding research and writing efforts
zemith.com
.
Expand Sections into Subsections and Key Questions – With the top-level outline set, the tool should break down each section into more detailed subsections or bullet points. One effective strategy (already being used) is to frame key questions that each section or subsection must answer. For instance, for the Introduction, questions might be: “What is the background of this topic?”, “Why is this research important in the current context (e.g. security environment)?”, “What exactly will this paper argue or investigate?” For the Methodology: “What data or evidence will be used?”, “How will it be collected or analyzed?”, “Why is this method appropriate?”
academia.stackexchange.com
. Each section of a research paper has certain essential questions it should address, and enumerating these ensures thorough coverage. Essentially, the system is generating a checklist of content for each part of the paper – a practice aligned with expert advice to keep a personal checklist of points that need to be covered in each section
academia.stackexchange.com
. Accomplishments: By the end of this stage, every section and subsection in the outline has one or more guiding questions or prompts. This granularity will drive the next steps by clearly specifying what information is needed. It’s important, however, that the tool remains flexible – not every paper will require every question to be answered in strict order, and some sections’ structure might evolve. The outline and questions can be iteratively updated if new insights emerge.
Identify and Gather Supporting Sources for Each Question – Now the system tackles each of the questions or sub-points identified, one by one. For each question, the tool searches the collected literature (from Stage 2) and potentially performs additional targeted searches to find the best evidence or citations that answer it. In this stage, the focus is on collecting specific facts, findings, or quotes that will be used to build the content of the paper. This might mean retrieving statistics from a quantitative study to answer a Results question, or excerpting an expert’s analysis from a report to answer a Discussion point. The key here is to ensure credible and relevant sources are used for every important claim. In rigorous fields like intelligence and security, using credible and diverse sources grounds your arguments in quality evidence
zemith.com
. The system should prefer peer-reviewed articles, authoritative reports, and primary data over unvetted sources, given the user’s selected source types. Accomplishments: For each outline point, compile a set of citations (with any pertinent quotations or data notes) that directly address the guiding question. Essentially, the tool is building a mini bibliographic database tied to the outline. By the end of this stage, there should be a solid factual basis (with references) ready for every section of the paper. This ensures that when writing, the system can cite evidence seamlessly to support each argument or statement.
Draft the Methodology Section – Armed with the outline and references, the tool can begin drafting full prose in an order that makes sense. Following best practices, it’s wise to start with sections that are more straightforward and concrete, such as the Methodology (if the paper involves one)
ref-n-write.com
. In a quantitative study, the Methodology section would describe the research design, data sources, procedures, and analysis techniques. In a qualitative or analytical paper, this section might outline the analytical framework or case study approach. For a literature-review-centric paper, this section could be a description of how the literature was surveyed (databases used, keywords, selection criteria). The objective of the Methodology section is to clearly explain how the research is conducted and why that approach is suitable, so that the reader trusts the process. The tool should fill in details such as: Data Collection – e.g., “We gathered data from X sources or via Y experiment”; Procedure – “We then analyzed the data using Z method or thematic coding,” and so on. If the methodology relies on prior work (for instance, a standard algorithm or well-known protocol), citations should be included to show it’s established. It’s often easiest to write this section because it’s largely a factual recounting of what the researcher (or analyst) will do or did, without needing interpretation
ref-n-write.com
. Accomplishments: Complete a draft of the Methodology section that answers all the “how” questions (and “why this method” if not already in Discussion). At this point, writing it early also forces clarity – it ensures the planned research approach is feasible and clear. (If any part of the method seems unsupported or unclear, the tool may flag that now, possibly prompting a return to literature review to find support or adjustments to the approach.)
Execute Analysis and Compile Results/Findings – In a live research scenario, this stage is where the actual study is carried out (experiments run, data analyzed, or in a policy analysis context, sources are examined to produce findings). In the context of the writing tool, this translates to organizing the Results section or the core findings of the paper. If it’s a quantitative study, the tool would take the hypothetical or provided data and describe the outcomes (e.g. statistical results, trends observed). For a qualitative study or analytic report, the “Results” might be the findings from source analysis – for example, key themes identified in documents, or evidence gathered from case studies. If the paper is a pure literature review, this stage would be where the tool synthesizes the literature into major findings or themes (since in a lit review, the “results” are essentially the integrated insights from prior studies). The system should use the outline and references compiled to systematically report what was found for each objective or sub-question. This part should be written objectively and clearly, often in past tense, describing facts without interpretation or commentary. Writing the results tends to be straightforward because it’s based on data that’s already known at this point – “you simply have to put [the findings] in figures and tables” or described in text
ref-n-write.com
. Accomplishments: The Results/Findings section is drafted in full, covering each result relevant to the research questions. It should be organized (potentially with subheadings corresponding to each research question or logical category of results) so that a reader can easily see the answers emerging from the analysis. Each result should be supported by data or citations (e.g., “According to the dataset, 78% of incidents were X【source】” or “Multiple sources confirm an increasing trend in Y【source】”). By the end of this stage, the factual core of the paper is on paper. This is a major milestone – the remaining stages will involve interpretation and framing of these results.
Write the Discussion/Analysis Section – The Discussion (or Analysis) section is where the tool transitions from what was found to what it means. This is often the most challenging part of a research paper to write, because it requires critical thinking and interpretation
ref-n-write.com
. Here, the system should take each major finding from the Results and interpret it in context of the original research question and the literature reviewed. Key objectives for the Discussion include: answering whether the findings support the original thesis or hypotheses (e.g., “Are the hypotheses/objectives confirmed?”)
academia.stackexchange.com
, explaining the implications of the findings (why they matter, how they advance understanding or practice), comparing or contrasting with prior studies (does the result align with what others found, or is it novel?), and noting any unexpected results. In the context of defense/security intelligence, this is where an analyst would also discuss the implications of the findings for policy or security posture, etc. The tool should use the citations from the literature review to support this discussion – for instance, “Our finding that A increased is consistent with Smith (2023)
zemith.com
, but contradicts the earlier work of Jones (2021), suggesting new factors at play.” The Discussion should also address limitations: every study has constraints (maybe the data sample was small or certain variables not controlled), and acknowledging these is important for a professional tone. Additionally, many papers include a few sentences on future work or recommendations in the discussion or conclusion, which the tool can include if appropriate (especially if the user’s domain expects recommendations). Accomplishments: Produce a well-structured Discussion section that interprets the results in depth. This section should effectively “answer” the research question posed in the introduction, by explaining how the evidence leads to that answer. It should also weave in the literature: confirming if this paper’s findings fill the gap or how they compare to existing knowledge. Throughout, the writing should remain objective and analytical – if the system is unsure about a particular interpretation, it might phrase it cautiously or note it as an area for further investigation (emulating human analysts who hedge claims). By the end of this stage, the main content of the paper (Method, Results, Discussion) is drafted. The thesis or central argument should now be fully supported by the results and analysis.
Refine the Introduction Section – With the heavy analytical work done, the tool circles back to the beginning of the paper – the Introduction – to flesh it out properly. Initially, we only had a skeleton of the intro (general problem statement and thesis). Now, knowing exactly what the paper contains, the system can write a much stronger, more detailed introduction. It’s often recommended that the Introduction be written or polished after the Discussion, because by then you “have a better understanding of the significance of your work”
ref-n-write.com
. In our automated process, the Introduction section should now accomplish several things: grab the reader’s attention with the context or importance of the topic (e.g., “Cybersecurity threats have grown exponentially in the past decade, threatening national security.”), summarize the state of knowledge (a bit of the literature context can be mentioned here in a condensed form, to situate the problem), state the specific research question or objective that the paper addresses (refined precisely as it stands after the research), and outline the approach that was taken (for example, “This paper conducts a quantitative analysis of X to test the hypothesis that Y…” or “This study reviews relevant literature and presents a thematic analysis on Z.”). Essentially, the introduction is the roadmap for the reader – it tells them what and why, and sometimes how. Because we’re finalizing it now, we can ensure it matches the content: for instance, if the focus shifted slightly during analysis, the introduction will reflect that adjusted focus. One experienced researcher quipped that you often “don’t know where you’re going until you’ve been there,” hence the introduction (and especially the abstract) is best written at the end when you do know where you went
researchgate.net
. Accomplishments: The Introduction section is now completed, containing a clear statement of the research problem, the thesis or answer that the paper will argue (which may be phrased as a summary of findings), and an overview of what follows. It should also convey the motivation for the work – why it matters – which is crucial in defense and intelligence contexts to justify the analysis. At this stage the tool should double-check that the introduction’s claims align with the conclusions drawn later. Any key definitions or background information the reader needs should be introduced here as well (supported by citations from literature as necessary). The introduction, along with the title, should give a strong first impression of the paper’s purpose and scope.
Draft the Conclusion Section – The Conclusion is the bookend to the Introduction. Now that the full argument has been made, the system writes the concluding section to bring closure. The Conclusion should summarize the main findings or arguments of the paper in a concise way, directly answering the research question posed. It often revisits the thesis statement from the intro (now stated with the benefit of the evidence presented). For example: “In conclusion, the analysis found that Y is strongly correlated with Z, supporting the hypothesis and indicating that…”. Beyond restating the results, a good conclusion also highlights the significance of those findings: what do they imply for the field or the real-world problem? In an intelligence report, this is where you’d emphasize what the findings mean for decision-makers. The conclusion might also acknowledge again any limitations (briefly) and suggest areas for future research or actions, if applicable (e.g., “Further investigation could explore A in more depth, which was beyond the scope of this study.”). It’s important that the conclusion does not introduce any new evidence or arguments that weren’t in the main body; it should only synthesize and reflect. As with the intro, it’s widely agreed that the conclusion should be written at the end of the project, when everything else is done – it is essentially a summary of the entire paper
ref-n-write.com
. Accomplishments: The Conclusion section is completed, providing a clear answer to the research question and a final takeaway for the reader. It should leave the reader with a sense of closure and the importance of the work. At this point, the paper’s narrative from introduction through conclusion is coherent and complete. The system should ensure that the conclusion aligns with the promises made in the intro and the evidence given in the body (for instance, if the intro set up a question, the conclusion explicitly answers it). In many cases, especially in professional analysis, the conclusion might also contain a brief recommendation or implication (e.g., “Therefore, policymakers should consider…”), tying the research back to practical outcomes.
Write the Abstract (and Title) Last – The abstract is a compact summary that appears at the very front of the paper, but it is almost always written after all other sections are finalized
researchgate.net
. The system’s final writing step is to produce this abstract, which typically is one paragraph (150-300 words depending on requirements) encapsulating the introduction, method, key results, and conclusion. In other words, it should answer: What was the topic? What did you do? What did you find? What do those findings mean? – all in a very condensed form. Writing it last is crucial because the abstract must reflect the exact contents of the paper; by now the tool knows those details thoroughly. (One witty definition calls an abstract “the part of a research paper that comes first but is written at the end”
researchgate.net
.) Similarly, the paper’s title can be finalized at this stage to accurately describe the study. The system can use the refined thesis and conclusions to craft a title that is informative yet concise. Accomplishments: A finished abstract that can stand alone to give any reader a snapshot of the entire study, and a clear title. After this, all sections of the paper are written.
Iterative Revision and Quality Check – With a full draft in hand (from Title and Abstract down to References), the tool should enter a revision phase to polish the work. In a manual writing process, revision is where an author might re-read the entire paper multiple times, each time focusing on different aspects – content, flow, clarity, grammar, etc.
zemith.com
. An automated system can mimic this by performing checks for logical coherence, consistency, and completeness. For example, the tool should verify that the Introduction and Conclusion correspond (the claims made in the intro are answered in the conclusion), that all factual statements are backed by citations, and that there is a smooth progression of ideas between sections. If the system finds any logical gaps or unanswered questions, it can return to earlier stages: perhaps add an explanation in Discussion, or include another source in the Literature Review to address a point. This is also the time to refine the wording for clarity and ensure the tone is professional. In a multi-pass revision approach, the first pass might focus on big-picture structure and arguments (does everything make sense? Is the thesis well-supported?)
zemith.com
. The next pass can improve paragraph-level organization and transitions. A final pass would check sentence-level details, typos, and formatting. As the saying goes, “writing is rewriting”, and systematic editing is what turns a raw draft into a polished, persuasive paper
zemith.com
. Accomplishments: The end of this stage results in a final manuscript that is well-organized, clearly written, and ready for whatever the next step is (be it user review, publishing, or briefing delivery). Importantly, during revision the system can also refine the thesis statement one last time if needed – for instance, ensuring the phrasing in the Introduction truly captures the conclusion reached. This addresses the point that the thesis might be verified or slightly adjusted once all evidence is assembled (something the system should do to maintain accuracy). Additionally, the tool should compile the full reference list of all sources cited, ensuring proper citation formatting (to avoid plagiarism and give credit, which is essential in scholarly and intelligence work alike).
Throughout this process, it’s acceptable – even expected – that the tool may loop back to earlier steps. For example, while drafting the Discussion, the system might realize a certain study from the literature is highly relevant to interpreting a result, prompting it to retrieve that source and include a citation (augmenting the literature review). Or after writing the conclusion, it might go back to the Introduction to tweak the framing of the research question for better alignment. This iterative refinement mirrors how human writers work: very rarely is everything perfect in one pass. By working on some sections in parallel or out-of-order (e.g. drafting Methods and Results early, and delaying the final Intro/Abstract), the tool can optimize the flow of writing
researchgate.net
ref-n-write.com
. For instance, if at some point the user provides new input or feedback (perhaps clarifying the thesis or adding a data source), the system can update the outline or revisit the literature search as needed.
Section-Specific Goals and Best Practices
To summarize the above in terms of each major section of a research paper, below are the key goals and the timing for each:
Introduction: Goal: Introduce the topic and its significance, present the research question/thesis, and outline what the paper will cover. It should motivate why the research is important (for analysts, this might mean the real-world stakes or policy relevance). Process: Draft a minimal version at the start (problem statement and tentative thesis) and finalize it after the Results/Discussion are complete, so it accurately previews the study’s outcome
ref-n-write.com
. Ensure it reflects any thesis refinements made along the way. By the end, the introduction should confidently state the purpose and approach of the paper, now that “you know where you’ve been” in the research
researchgate.net
.
Literature Review (Background): Goal: Survey existing knowledge and prior work on the topic. It should establish what is already known, what debates or gaps exist, and how the current research will contribute. In doing so, it lends credibility and context to the study
zemith.com
. Process: Perform the literature search and analysis early on (to guide the research direction and methodology), but write or polish this section after the main analysis to keep it tightly relevant. The lit review content gathered should be pruned down to studies that directly inform the research question or interpretation of results. This section also implicitly demonstrates the researcher’s (or tool’s) expertise in the subject area by being comprehensive yet focused.
Methodology: Goal: Describe how the research was conducted. In an experimental or data-driven paper, it explains the design, data sources, procedures, and analysis methods, allowing others to evaluate or replicate the work. In a qualitative or intelligence analysis paper, it explains the approach (e.g., case study selection, analytical framework, or how sources were vetted). Process: Write this section early, right after planning the study, since it’s straightforward and ensures clarity on the approach
ref-n-write.com
. Revisit it during revision to add any justifications or clarify steps if questions arose. By the final draft, the methodology should answer all “what and how” questions about the research process
academia.stackexchange.com
, giving readers confidence in the rigor of the approach.
Results/Findings: Goal: Present the raw findings of the study or analysis objectively. For scientific research, this means data results (tables, figures, descriptive and inferential statistics). For qualitative or literature-based research, it means the key themes or observations that emerged. Process: Compile and write this section once data gathering/analysis is done (mid-way in the chronology). It’s often one of the easiest sections to write because it’s purely reporting what was found, without commentary
ref-n-write.com
. Still, it should be well-organized (perhaps grouped by sub-question or hypothesis) and include only pertinent results. Ensure each result directly relates to the research question or supports the forthcoming discussion. If the tool is generating this, it might use a straightforward language and incorporate figures or direct quotes from sources as evidence here.
Discussion/Analysis: Goal: Interpret the results and explain their meaning. This section should answer “So what do these findings imply?” It should relate back to the thesis and to the literature: confirming if the hypothesis was supported, discussing how the findings fit into the broader context, and what new insights are gained. It often also covers limitations (factors that might affect the results’ validity or generalizability) and possibly recommendations or future research avenues. Process: Write this after results are laid out. This section benefits from going hand-in-hand with the Introduction: some writers draft bits of the discussion earlier or concurrently to ensure they’re gathering the right evidence, but generally the full analysis crystallizes once results are known. The tool should leverage the literature in this section heavily – every claim about meaning can be bolstered by referencing prior studies (agreement or disagreement). Because the Discussion is challenging, the system might iterate on it multiple times, checking that each conclusion drawn is supported. The end of the Discussion should effectively answer the research question posed, setting up the final Conclusion section.
Conclusion: Goal: Provide closure by succinctly summarizing the main argument or findings and their significance. It should reassert the answer to the research question and leave the reader with the key takeaway. In some cases, it may offer a brief forward-looking statement (e.g., importance of continuing research, or implications for policy or practice). Process: Draft this after the discussion – essentially at the very end of writing – because it must encapsulate the entire paper
ref-n-write.com
. The tool should ensure the tone in the conclusion is confident and that it does not simply repeat the discussion verbatim but distills it. One good practice is for the tool to cross-check: if the introduction posed specific questions or objectives, the conclusion should address each of them. Given the user’s domain, the conclusion might also explicitly state any recommendations or actionable insights (if not already in discussion). This section, like the intro, can be short and to the point.
Abstract: Goal: Provide a standalone summary of the paper for quick reader reference. Often, it’s what busy decision-makers or scholars read first to decide if the paper is relevant. It should contain the essence of the introduction (the what/why), the methodology (briefly how), the main results (what was found), and the conclusion (what it means) – all in a very condensed form. Process: Always write the abstract last. As noted, it effectively writes itself once every section is finalized, because it’s just picking the most critical lines from each. The tool should be careful to keep it within any word limit and make it understandable even to those who might not read the full paper. If the paper is for an academic context, the abstract may also include keywords at the end (the system can extract those from the content). And if an executive summary or similar section is required (common in intelligence reports), the tool would produce that in a similar fashion at the end, after knowing all details.
By following this ideal chronology and section-by-section objectives, the automated research paper assistant can work in a logical, human-like workflow. It ensures that at early stages the focus is on gathering knowledge and planning (outline, questions, sources), and at later stages on writing and refining – rather than trying to write everything perfectly in one go. Notably, the process is iterative: the tool should be prepared to loop back (for example, updating the literature review if the discussion demands more context, or refining the thesis in the introduction after seeing the final results). This mirrors the reality that a first draft is simply raw material, and it’s through revision that a truly polished paper emerges
zemith.com
. In an automated system, this might translate to multiple passes over the content, each time checking a different aspect (structure, then clarity, then citations, etc.), akin to how a human would do successive edits
zemith.com
.
Finally, it’s worth noting that while the above sequence is a recommended order, flexibility is important. Different projects might benefit from slight adjustments. For instance, a purely theoretical paper might not have a “Results” section separate from Discussion. Or a rapid intelligence brief might interweave background and analysis rather than having a formal literature review. The tool should be able to recognize the type of output required and adapt the outline accordingly. However, the underlying principles remain: start with a plan, gather evidence, write easier parts first, save the definitive framing for last, and always revise. By implementing this methodology in code – essentially instructing the system to follow these stages and to revisit sections as needed – the auto-report generator will emulate expert writers and produce well-structured, coherent, and credible research papers. Each section will accomplish its intended purpose and collectively they will deliver a compelling paper that stands up to professional scrutiny, whether in academia or in the field of security and intelligence.
