Challenging European Security Order [1] \n            a. \"The intervention shattered the post-Cold War European security system, fundamentally challenging assumptions that no state would attempt to redraw national borders by force.\" [1]\n        2. Rejecting Liberal International Order [1, 3]\n            a.  \"It represented a decisive Russian rejection of the US/EU-led liberal international order and an attempt to establish new 'rules of the game' more favorable to Russian interests.\" [1]\n            b. Supported by [3]: \"They reflected Russia's rejection of Western liberal democracy promotion and the determination to secure a multipolar international system with several power centres.\"\n        3. Return to East-West Rivalry [1]\n            a. \"This crisis marks the end of the post-Cold War period in Europe and a regression to a situation of open geopolitical hostility and rivalry between Russia and the West.\" [1]\n\nAdditional Resources:\n- Historical accounts and government reports on the Ukraine and Syria interventions\n- Analyses by regional experts and think tanks\n- International legal frameworks related to use of force and intervention\n- Proposed solutions from policymakers and security experts"

I supplemented this with Allison's analysis [4.3] of Russia's underlying strategic interests in propping up the Assad regime in Syria, highlighting potential contradictions between the public rhetoric and realpolitik factors.\n\nHowever, the provided citations do not substantially address the latter part of the research question regarding the alignment of stated motivations with actual outcomes and consequences. While [4.3] offers some broader context, there is a lack of authoritative information evaluating the real-world impacts and implications of Russia's actions.\n\nTo comprehensively answer this question, additional resources are required that provide:\n1) Factual timelines and details of Russian military operations and tactics  \n2) Strategic analyses by experts/think-tanks on geopolitical and humanitarian impacts\n3) Reports from international bodies on legal/rights violations  \n4) Perspectives from Syrian and Ukrainian societies affected by the interventions\n\nConsulting such supplementary sources would allow for a more holistic assessment comparing Russia's rhetoric to the substantive consequences of its interventions, ultimately better addressing the research question's central inquiry."

(2017), p. 12]\n2. \"The core principles of international humanitarian law are: the protection of persons not participating in hostilities; the prohibition of means and methods of warfare that cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering; and the prohibition of acts intended to spread terror among the civilian population.\" [Bellal, A. (Ed.). (2017), p. 13]\n\nB. Ethical Principles\n1. \"From an ethical perspective, the resort to armed force should always be a last resort and should be strictly limited to cases where it is necessary and proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.\" [Bellal, A. (Ed.). (2017), p. 33]\n2. \"The principles of humanity, impartiality, neutrality and independence underpin humanitarian action and are derived from the fundamental principle of humanity.\" [Bellal, A. (Ed.). (2017), p. 41]\n   a. \"The principle of humanity is a call to alleviate and prevent human suffering wherever it may be found.\" [Bellal, A. (Ed.). (2017), p. 41]\n   b. \"The principle of impartiality requires that humanitarian assistance be provided solely on the basis of need, without discrimination.\" [Bellal, A. (Ed.). (2017), p. 42]\n   c. \"The principle of neutrality means that humanitarian actors must not take sides in hostilities or engage in controversies of a political, racial, religious or ideological nature.\" [Bellal, A. (Ed.). (2017), p. 42]\n   d. \"The principle of independence requires that humanitarian action be autonomous from the political, economic, military or other objectives that any actor may hold with regard to areas where humanitarian action is being implemented.\" [Bellal, A. (Ed.). (2017), p. 43]\n\nC. Principles of the United Nations Charter\n• \"The purposes and principles of the United Nations, as enshrined in the UN Charter, constitute the foundational framework of contemporary international law.\" [Bellal, A. (Ed.). (2017), p. 47]\n• Key principles include:\n   - \"Prohibition on the use of force except in self-defense or with Security Council authorization\" [Bellal, A. (Ed.). (2017), p. 48]\n   - \"Respect for the territorial integrity and political independence of states\" [Bellal, A. (Ed.). (2017), p. 48]\n   - \"Peaceful settlement of disputes\" [Bellal, A. (Ed.).

Direct Military Intervention (September 2015 - Present)\n        - \"On September 30, 2015, Russia began air strikes against rebel targets across western Syria.\"\n        - \"Russian warplanes launched cruise missiles from the Caspian Sea, and the Russian Navy deployed ships off Syria's coast in the Mediterranean.\" [Souleimanov & Krause, 2017, p. 38]\n\nIV. Challenges to Regional Stability and Global Security\n    A. Escalating Proxy Conflict\n        - \"Russia's intervention transformed the Syrian conflict into an arena for great-power rivalry, with the United States leading a coalition backing rebel forces while Russia intervened on behalf of the Assad regime.\" [Souleimanov & Krause, 2017, p. 39]\n    B. Potential for Wider Conflict\n        - \"There were also fears that the Russian intervention could lead to direct confrontation between Russian and U.S. forces operating in Syria.\" [Souleimanov & Krause, 2017, p. 39]\n    C.

Additional Resources\n    Based on the citation outlines, the following additional resources may be useful:\n    - Reports from other major human rights organizations (e.g. Human Rights Watch reports on Ukraine, Syrian Network for Human Rights reports)\n    - United Nations reports and investigations into violations in Ukraine and Syria\n    - Analysis from international legal experts on application of humanitarian law\n    - Regional experts and policy analysts with insights into geopolitical context\n\nThis master outline consolidates the evidence from the three citations on human rights violations committed by Russian forces in Ukraine and Syria. It groups the violations into thematic categories, highlighting unlawful attacks on civilians, extrajudicial killings, torture, forced displacement, and use of prohibited weapons like cluster munitions. The outline maps these specific violations to relevant provisions of international humanitarian law, human rights treaties, and the laws of armed conflict that Russia's actions have potentially contravened. No direct contradictions between the citations were identified. Additional resources from UN bodies, legal experts, and regional analysts are suggested to further substantiate the analysis."

Energy Interests\n            a. \"...ensuring the security of existing and potential energy supply routes from the region.\" [1.2, Allison]\n        4. Military Factors\n            a. \"Another factor is Moscow's interest in maintaining its strategic Mediterranean naval presence in Syrian ports.\" [1.2, Allison] \n            b. \"Russia has a stake in demonstrating that it remains an influential global military actor...\" [1.2, Allison]\n\n    C. Patterns Across Interventions\n        1. \"Russia's reactions aimed to reassert its interests as a great power in regions of perceived strategic vulnerability vis-a-vis perceived Western encroachments.\" [1.1, Tsygankov]\n\nII. Tactics Employed by Russia\n\n    A. Ukraine \n        1. Annexation of Crimea\n            a. \"Russia proceeded with the annexation of Crimea and supported separatists in eastern Ukraine's Donbass region.\" [1.1, Tsygankov]\n        2. Hybrid Warfare in Donbass\n            a. \"Russia's initial military intervention in Crimea in February 2014 was a well-executed special operation.\" [1.3, Charap et al.]\n                i. \"Russian military intelligence officers, backed by military forces and pro-Russian militia groups, rapidly secured key facilities and infrastructure across Crimea.\" [1.3, Charap et al.]\n            b. \"In eastern Ukraine, Russia pursued a different model of hybrid warfare, stopping short of overt military intervention and relying on local proxies and deniable forms of support.\" [1.3, Charap et al.]\n    \n    B. Syria\n        - No details provided in the cited sources regarding specific military tactics employed by Russia in Syria.\n\nIII. Contradictions\n    - There is no direct contradiction between the three citations regarding Russia's strategic motivations and tactics in the military interventions in Ukraine.\n    - Citation 1 [Tsygankov] does not provide any quotes relevant to Russia's motivations or tactics in Syria, while Citations 2 [Allison] and 3 [Charap et al.] do not cover tactics in Syria.\n\nIV. Additional Considerations\n    - While the provided citations offer insights into Russia's motivations and actions in Ukraine, more sources examining the Syrian intervention's tactics, timeline, and consequences would help provide a fuller picture.\n    - Perspectives from regional experts, international bodies like the UN, and Russian government sources could further contextualize Russia's stated rationale versus its perceived strategic goals.\n    - Deeper analysis of Russia's domestic political dynamics, military capabilities, economic interests, and regional alliance dynamics may shed light on additional drivers behind these interventions."

Legal Justifications\n    1. \"The most legally cogent Russian argument was based on the Responsibility to Protect (R2P) doctrine by asserting the need to protect Russian citizens trapped in what Moscow presented as an illegally constituted, US-inspired regime brought about by Euromaidan protests that threatened massive loss of life and violated the civil rights of ethnic Russians.\" [Allison, R. (2014).]\n    2. \"Russia claimed that the February 2014 change of power in Ukraine represented an unconstitutional coup d'état, and therefore the authorities in Kyiv were not legitimate.\" [Allison, R. (2014).]\n\nB. Ethical Justifications\n    1. \"Another rationale advanced by Moscow was the need to prevent a 'humanitarian catastrophe' in eastern Ukraine as a result of fighting between the government and pro-Russian separatists.\" [Allison, R. (2014).]\n    2. \"The Russian stance was that ethnic Russians in Crimea needed to be defended from the emergent threat of Ukrainian nationalism and alleged anti-Russian discrimination.\" [Allison, R. (2014).]\n\nII. Scrutiny of Russia's Justifications\nA. Legal Scrutiny\n    1. \"R2P was intended to prevent genocide and large-scale human rights violations in sovereign states, not to protect a country's own citizens abroad—and there was no genocide in Ukraine.\" [Allison, R. (2014).]\n    2. \"There was no solid evidence that ethnic Russians in Crimea were genuinely threatened in a way that might have justified military intervention.\" [Allison, R. (2014).]\n\nB. Ethical Scrutiny\n    1. \"Claims of a humanitarian catastrophe were also undermined by the lack of proof that Kyiv had committed large-scale human rights violations against pro-Russian populations, or had lost control of security in eastern Ukraine.\" [Allison, R. (2014).]\n    2. \"Further, the hasty annexation of Crimea removed any possibility of a peaceful resolution to the conflict that might have addressed minority rights concerns.\" [Allison, R.

Analysis of justifications under international law\n    1. Self-defense argument\n        a. \"The difficulty with the Russian argument is that the right of self-defence is traditionally understood as a defence against an armed attack by another State.\" [Sari, p. 5]\n        b. \"The attacks by non-State actors, such as IS, cannot be regarded as an 'armed attack' which would give rise to the right of self-defence on behalf of the government of Syria.\" [Sari, p. 5]\n    2.

Journal of International Affairs, 68(2), 115-138.]\n\nGrouping of Supporting Factors:\nCitations [1.1] and [1.2] both highlight Russia's violations of the principles of territorial integrity, sovereignty, and non-intervention in Ukraine and Syria, as evidenced by the following quotes:\n\n- \"Russia's intervention in Crimea flagrantly breached the foundational international norm of respect for the territorial integrity of other states.\" [1.1]\n- \"The duty of non-intervention [...] requires the respect for the territorial integrity and political independence of every State.\" [1.2]\n- \"The prohibition of intervention precludes any military and non-military intervention by States in the internal or external affairs of other States without their consent.\" [1.2]\n\nCitations [1.1] and [1.2] also point to specific treaties and conventions violated by Russia's actions, including the UN Charter, Helsinki Final Act, Budapest Memorandum, and principles of international humanitarian law.\n\nBoth citations [1.1] and [1.2] express concerns about human rights violations and potential war crimes committed by Russia or its allies in Ukraine and Syria.\n\nContradictions:\nThere is a potential contradiction between citations [1.2] and [1.1] regarding the legality of interventions for human rights purposes. Citation [1.2] states:\n\n\"Human rights law may place certain limits on what a State may permissibly do to its own citizens on its own territory, and intervention in such cases by other States is no longer regarded as unlawful per se.\" [Talmon, p. 176]\n\nThis suggests that interventions aimed at addressing human rights violations may not necessarily violate the principle of non-intervention. However, citation [1.1] expresses concerns about Russia's \"potential complicity in war crimes and human rights violations by the Assad regime, including indiscriminate attacks on civilian populations\" in Syria, implying that Russia's intervention did not comply with human rights norms.\n\nAdditional Resources:\nBased on the provided citations, an analyst may want to consider the following additional resources:\n\n1. Detailed analyses of specific treaties and conventions cited, such as the UN Charter, Helsinki Final Act, and Budapest Memorandum, to further understand the scope and implications of Russia's violations.\n\n2. Reports and documentation from international bodies, such as the UN Human Rights Council or International Criminal Court, regarding potential war crimes and human rights abuses committed in Ukraine and Syria.\n\n3. Legal opinions and scholarly works that explore the boundaries and exceptions to the principle of non-intervention, particularly in cases involving human rights concerns or humanitarian crises.\n\n4. Geopolitical analyses and regional experts' perspectives on the broader motivations and strategic implications of Russia's interventions in Ukraine and Syria, beyond the legal and normative violations.\n\nPlease note that this outline strictly adheres to the information provided in the citations and does not introduce any external content or analysis."

Need for concerted international response\n      A. \"In the face of this threat, a renewed commitment to upholding international norms is essential.\" [Monaghan, p. 68]\n      B. \"A concerted effort to confront and constrain Russia's revisionist agenda is needed.\" [Monaghan, p. 68]\n\nIn summary, the outlined points from the cited source highlight how Russia's military interventions in Ukraine and Syria have destabilized regional security environments, challenged global security norms and international laws, and necessitate a coordinated international response to maintain peace and uphold established rules and principles governing interstate relations.

The evidence highlights Russia's use of force, defiance of the UN Charter, indiscriminate attacks on civilians, support for human rights abuses, and undermining of conflict resolution efforts. However, there is a noticeable gap in information from Citation 3 regarding Russia's violations in Ukraine specifically. To further strengthen the analysis, additional resources are recommended, including historical accounts, government reports, scholarly analyses, legal frameworks, and regional experts."
